Description: Functions for analysis of bulk data generated from experiments in Randomized block design as per Panse and Sukhatme (1954) <https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Efo9AAAAYAAJ>. Computes analysis of variance; Descriptive statistics parameter like Mean, Minimum, Maximum, CV, Standard error of mean, Standard Error of deviation, CD; Genetic parameter statistics Genotypic Coefficient of Variation, Phenotypic Coefficient of Variation, Heritability in broad sense, Genetic Advance and Genetic Advance per cent mean; Variance and Co-variance matrix of genotypic, phenotypic and environmental; Correlation of genotypic, phenotypic and environmental. Further includes directly publication ready tables.
